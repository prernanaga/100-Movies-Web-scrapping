# WHAT IS WEB SCRAPING?
* Web Scrapping also known as web harvesting or web data extraction, refers to the process of extracting data from websites. This extraction of data can be accomplished using 
web scraping software, which can either directly access the World Wide Web through the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or utilize a web browser for this purpose.
* Consequently the scraper can replicate the entire website's content in another location.

# COMMON USES OF WEB SCRAPING
* E-Commerce - Web Scraping effortlessly retrieves product data (price, description, images, reviews, ratings, etc.) from e-commerce sites like Amazon, Google, E-bay, etc.
* Sports Betting Odds Analysis - Various bookmarks collect betting odd values from sports betting websites like OddsPortal, BetExplorer, FlashScore etc.
* Academic Research - A Web Scraper facilitates effortless collection of structured data from multiple Internet sources, crucial for academic, marketing, and scientific research.
* Real Estate - Web scraping software can extract property details, as well as agent and owner contact information, from real estate websites like Zillow, Realtor, etc.
* Training and Testing Data for Machine Learning Projects - Web scraping enables the collection of data from various websites, which is essential for training and testing
high-quality Machine Learning models when the required data is not readily available.
